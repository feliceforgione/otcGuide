<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<br>

### Aids the consumer in choosing appropriate over-the-counter options. With the demands on pharmacists increasing and more stores selling over-the-counter products without a pharmacist on site, consumers are left on their own to choose from the growing number of over-the-counter selections.
